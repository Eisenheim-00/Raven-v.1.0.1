🚀 HOW TO INSTALL RAVEN'S UPDATED PACKAGES (2024):

IMPORTANT: We're now using the MODERN Alpaca SDK (alpaca-py)!

METHOD 1 - Simple Installation (Recommended):
1. Open VS Code terminal (Terminal → New Terminal)
2. Make sure virtual environment is active: raven_env\Scripts\activate
3. Copy and paste this command:
   python -m pip install alpaca-py pandas numpy yfinance scikit-learn joblib schedule requests

METHOD 2 - Using requirements.txt:
1. Save this file as "requirements.txt" in your Raven folder
2. Activate virtual environment: raven_env\Scripts\activate
3. Run: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

🎯 WHAT CHANGED FOR RAVEN:
✅ Updated to alpaca-py (modern 2024 SDK)
✅ Better API structure and reliability
✅ More professional trading interface
✅ Enhanced error handling

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:
The old alpaca-trade-api is being deprecated. Raven now uses the latest
alpaca-py SDK which is faster, more reliable, and officially supported.

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you get errors about conflicting packages:
1. python -m pip uninstall alpaca-trade-api  (remove old SDK)
2. python -m pip install alpaca-py  (install new SDK)
